    {"paragraph": "This is an interactive installation art. User can hit the red earthbag to smash the wall made of annoying words. When the wall is destroyed, a big red \"NO\" made of those fragments will show up. This work tries to convey the idea that we live in a world of unreasonable requests to which we should say no. Waving your fists when needed!\n\n"},
    {"paragraph": "This is a group project. I'm in charge of the unity development. I received the data from other's program when the earthbag is hit and change that into random hit on the text wall. The text wall is pre-shattered and keep static until a hit occurs.\n\n"},
