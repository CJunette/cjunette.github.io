    {"paragraph": "Head direction is often considered as a way to show one's interest, especially someone is look at something for a certain amount of time. So we track along the user's head direction and pick the first iot device as the \"target candidate\" . We use a progress circle to avoid unintentional activation. When a device is \"selected\", the use can interact with it by speaking out the command directly.\n\n"},
